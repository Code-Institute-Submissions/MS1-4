## The Blue Note Restaurant - [Live Site](https://justinmcc066.github.io/MS1/index.html)

The Blue Note is an imagined restaurant in the heart of Kerry's primary town, Tralee.

The purpose of this website is to inform both new and returning customers of the history, food and events this The Blue Note provides. It was important to provide the restaurant's opening hours, an option to book online and menus complete with allergen information and pricing.


## UX

The goal of this website is to:

* Provide potential customers with important information to promote the work and ethos of the restaurant.

* Increase the awareness around the restaurant and the effort that goes in to sourcing and growing the igredients.

* Provide a platform for customers to book online and reserve spaces for upcoming events held at the restaurant.

* Give visitors a full breakdown of the menu complete with allergen along with information regarding the restaurant's gluten free, vegan and vegetarian dishes.

A two colour blue colour palette was used throughout playing on the restaurant name, The Blue Note. The refined colour palette allows the food imagery to stand out.

Fonts used are:
* [Belleza](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Garamond) - Navigation/Dropdown
* [Cormorant Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Garamond) - Headings
* [Source Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Garamond) - Body Copy
* Georgia - Event Titles

All fonts (except for Gorgia) are linked from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) in the Style Sheet.


## Features

Features of this site include:

### Navigation
The navbar contains the restaurant logo and five main links and three dropdown links. Two of the main five links are anchor links leading to sections on the home page.

### Online Booking Form
Reservations can be made online for any number of guests with early bird time slots available also.

### Menu List
Three menus have been provided covering all dishes available at the restaurant - Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. The items include a description of the dish, allergen information, dietary information and pricing.

### Image Carousel
Each menu (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) has a revolving image carousel. This feature enhances the experience of the menu by allowing the visitor to see the dishes available at the restaurant.

### Event Gallery
Upcoming events gallery showcases the events held weekly at the restaurant with a short introduction. Each event has it's own dedicated page.

### Single Event Page
Dedicated event pages display all information regarding the event, along with imagery and the option to register for the event.

### Event Registration
Any visitor can register for the weekly events by submitting their email and number of persons attending - limited to four.

### Newsletter Sign-Up
Visitors can sign up to a newsletter to keep up to date with restaurant news and upcoming events.

### Contact Form
Visitors can contact the restaurant via the contact page using the contact form for any further information or queries.

### Footer
The footer dislays links to the restaurants social media accounts, the restaurant location and site author information.


### Features Left to Implement
A feature I would like to implement would be an image change on hover for the food menus. This would take the place of the image carousel and would allow the visitor to selevtively view an image of each listed dish.
